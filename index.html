  <h1>Spending Treemap</h1>

  <p id="chart"></p>

  <aside>Click any cell to zoom in, or the top orange label to zoom out.</aside>

  <p>Treemaps are a form of <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/treemap.html">space</a><a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/pack.html">-filling</a> <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/sunburst.html">layout</a> where the area of each rectangle is proportional to its value.</p>

  <p>Treemaps visualize hierarchical data, but since often only the leaf nodes (files rather than folders) are drawn, it can be difficult to see the hierarchy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tree_Map.png">Padding</a> is sometimes used to show the hierarchy via containment, though this introduces area distortion. <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/ctm.pdf">Cushion gradients</a> also indicate hierarchy, but are somewhat unintuitive (or perhaps just ugly).</p>

  <p>The treemap above uses interaction to reveal the hierarchy incrementally: clicking on a node zooms in. Only two levels of the hierarchy are visible at a time. This allows the layout’s aspect ratio (ideally φ) to be optimized for the current view, rather than computing a global layout. It also allows the exploration of arbitrarily-large datasets: data can be lazily-loaded and positioned on zoom!</p>

  <p>This visualization is implemented in <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, based on an <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/treemap.html">earlier version</a> from my talk at SVG Open. Also see Nicolas Garcia Belmonte’s zoomable treemap of <a href="http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Treemap/example1.html">music albums</a>, and The New York Times’ free-form zooming for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/newsgraphics/2011/0119-budget/">Obama’s 2012 budget proposal</a>. Note the subtle differences in behavior!</p>
